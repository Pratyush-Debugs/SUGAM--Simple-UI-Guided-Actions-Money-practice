## 🛡️ Non-Negotiables & Guarantees

1. **One-Tap Master Switch (Zero Residue):**
   - Toggling the master switch off completely undoes every injected style and node from the page.
   - Screen reader announces `"SUGAM helpers off"`.
   - Injected UI uses a isolated Shadow DOM container (`#sugam-root`) which is completely removed from the DOM on teardown.
   - Bionic reading text modifications are restored cleanly and losslessly.
   - Toggling the switch back on re-applies previous user settings.
   - Includes a floating `"SUGAM is on: Turn off"` badge and shortcut (`Alt+Shift+S`).
2. **Never Submits or Moves Money:**
   - SUGAM **never** submits a form, approves a payment, or moves money.
   - The Form Wizard populates values using native setters, dispatches standard `input` and `change` events, and lets the user review and click submit on the website themselves.
3. **Sensitive Field & Privacy Protection:**
   - SUGAM **never** reads aloud, stores, logs, or sends PINs, OTPs, passwords, card numbers, or CVVs.
   - Sensitive domains (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Paytm, PhonePe, BHIM, Razorpay, Income Tax, UIDAI, etc.) automatically disable cloud calls and client-side timer freezing.
   - On encountering sensitive fields, the Form Wizard notifies the user with a calm note: *"This is a private password or PIN. SUGAM never touches private details. Please type directly into the website's own secure box."*
4. **On-Device by Default & Gemini AI Summarization:**
   - Free Gemini API (`gemini-3.8-flash` / `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) is used with user consent for summarization into at most 8 plain sentences with Indian context pictograms (Rupee, UPI, QR, OTP, Bank, Bill).
   - If offline or on sensitive pages, an on-device heuristic summarizer runs automatically.
5. **Honest Machine Output Disclaimers:**
   - *"This summary is made by a computer and may have mistakes. Check the original for money, health and legal information."*
   - *"Computer translation. Check amounts and dates in the original."*
   - *"SUGAM paused the on-screen clock. The website's own clock may still run."*

## 🧑‍💻 Development

Run these from the **repository root** (Node.js 20 or newer):

```bash
npm install          # once
npm test             # unit tests + verification suite
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run format       # Prettier (use format:check in CI)
```

- `SUGAM/extension/tests/unit/` holds `node:test` unit tests (storage, Gemini client, safe DOM helpers, Bionic Read, manifest).
- `SUGAM/extension/tests/verify-all.js` is the original verification suite. It exits with a non-zero code on any failure.
- Pull requests are checked by GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): lint, format check and tests.

Sample test pages for testing extension behavior:

- `tests/sample-article.html`: Article with English, Hindi, and Odia content.
- `tests/form-page.html`: 10-field application form for testing Form Wizard and sensitive field protection.
- `tests/countdown-page.html`: Page with client-side countdown timer for testing Level 1 & Level 2 timer freeze.

### Coding rules for this project

- **Never put text from a web page, storage, or the cloud AI into `innerHTML`.** Use `textContent`, DOM APIs, or the helpers in `shared/dom-safe.js` (`escapeHtml`, `safeHttpUrl`, `appendEmphasis`).
- **Secrets stay local.** The Gemini API key lives in `chrome.storage.local` only (see `shared/storage.js`) and is sent in a request header, never in a URL. The caregiver PIN is stored only as a salted hash.
- **Every helper must be reversible.** Anything a helper adds to a page must be removed by the master switch (`teardownAllHelpers`).
- **Bundled fonts** are in `fonts/` (SIL OFL 1.1). Their family names start with `SUGAM ` so they never change a website that uses a font of the same name.
- **Check the Gemini model name** in `shared/gemini.js` (`SUGAM_GEMINI_MODEL`) against Google's current model list before each release.
